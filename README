Based on the 5.0 version of the UNLedu Web Framework at http://wdn.unl.edu/

Requirements:
  - The 'wdn' directory from the UNLedu Web Framework project (https://github.com/unl/wdntemplates) containing template dependents (the CSS and JS) needs to be located (sym-link/shortcut is o.k.) at the root of the Drupal install.

CKEditor integration:
  - This theme includes a 'unl_five_ckeditor' sub-module. When enabled, this sub-module provides UNLedu Web Framework CSS files to CKEditor.
